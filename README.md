## About
This is my solution for the challenge of building an interactive rating component from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

This is my first challenge solution that involves the use of JavaScript. I had a lot fun figuring out how to display and hide two different contents on the same card component. Thankfully, I didn't have to use any complex logic to complete the challenge. It's a great way to practice my beginner JavaScript skills. Hopefully, it's only the first of many.

**Any feedback on how to improve my solution would be greatly appreciated**. ðŸ˜Š
## User Stories
The user should be able to:
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Built With
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Sass
- JavaScript

## Usage
You can download the project files by clicking on the green **Code** button, then select **Download Zip**.

Once you finish extracting, move into the project folder, open the terminal, and type the following code:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies.

To compile Sass into CSS and watch for any future changes, type the following code in your terminal:


```
npm run sass
```

To compile Sass into a minified version of CSS, run:

```
npm run prod
```
